          <h4>Wood's Famous Brimmer&nbsp;</h4>
          <p>
            Developed in the 1920s by W. T. Woods &amp; Sons of Richmond, Virginia,
            this tomato produces large 3 to 4-inch red fruit of perfect round
            shape. We are not certain whether this variety was developed as a
            canning tomato or as a dinner slicer because it makes the perfect
            BLT sandwich. That said, this tomato variety was created and bred in
            the Mid-Atlantic region, so it will thrive in our humid Midwestern
            summers and yield wildly off-the-books quantities of picture perfect
          monster red tomatoes. </p>

          <h4>Carbon Tomato</h4>
          <p>
            Winner of the 2005 “Heirloom Garden Show” best-tasting tomato award.
            These have won taste awards coast to coast in the last few years.
            The fruit is smooth, large, and beautiful, being one of the darkest
            and prettiest of the purple types we have seen. They seem to have an
            extra dose of the complex flavor that makes dark tomatoes famous.

          <p>
            Hollister Farms Favorite! Our #1 seller. This heirloom tomato dates
            back 100 years. Original seed was collected from West Virginia,
            where it had been grown for almost 100 years by a few mountain
            families, by the famed seedsman George Gleckler who introduced it in
            1958. This is the true Watermelon Beefsteak. Indeterminate,
            regular-leaf tomato plants that yield HUGE, 1-2 lb., pink, beefsteak
            tomatoes that are lightly scalloped and loaded with deliciously rich
            and complex, old-time tomato flavors.

            orange beefsteak tomato with some red marbling. Unusually strong
            flavors for a bi-colored.

        <li>
          <h4>Green Doctor's Cherry</h4>
          <p>
            A favorite green cherry variety, having a good sweetness and yet
            still has lots of tart flavor. Named after Dr. Amy Goldman and Dr.
            Carolyn Male, who have both written great tomato books. Fruit is
            yellowish-lime green with kiwi-green colored flesh. Large vines
            produce huge yields of these little cherries. Some plants produce
            bright green fruit; others produce “frosted” fruit, which is lighter
            in color and even sweeter.

            tomatoes that ripen further to an amber color. Great for growing in

            tangy flavor. A good variety for growing in containers.
