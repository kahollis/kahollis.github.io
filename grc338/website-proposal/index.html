She serves on the NLC board because she believes deeply in programs that connect students to learning, to their community and to their world. As one of the first participants in the “Empowering Educators” program, Melissa learned about the power of social-emotional learning, for educators and for students, and saw relational trust built at both levels, when students were invited in to train the educators. It has been her joy to watch students be empowered and flourish in the programs provided by NLC for nearly a decade. Her dreams for NLC include future programs in the performing arts, to further empower and connect students.</p>

					<h4> Wendy Ke</h4>
					<p> [Photo of Wendy Ke]</p>
					<p>I’ve always preferred being outdoors to indoors, where I feel most at “OM.” Connecting with nature is an essential part of my day that inspires and rejuvenates me and creates balance in my life. As a result, I’ve sought work and volunteer paths related to the natural environment including: working for local governments overseeing municipal environmental programs; guiding public and school naturalist programs as a National Park Service Ranger; leading active travel vacations internationally for Backroads; and volunteering in my daughter’s schools with hands on, science based programs/activities. During the time I devote to NLC’s experiential learning programs, I hope to instill in others a passion, curiosity, respect and appreciation for the natural world, as well as a desire to preserve and protect it.</p>

					<p>I am retired from information technology and have been an advocate for education for many years. I also volunteer with the John Muir Elementary PTA where supplementing education for all students is the first priority. Since joining New Leaf my desire is to work with community partners to help find resources to provide supplemental learning experiences inside and outside of the regular classroom. With a focus on science and technology I hope to help students prepare for their future in Martinez and surrounding communities.</p>

			<h2> Our Partners </h2>

			<h1>Get Involved</h1>
			<h2>Earth Ambassador Programs</h2>
			<h3>Recycling Ambassadors</h3>
			<p>New Leaf Collaborative is working with the City of Martinez, Republic Services, and the Martinez Unified School District to implement CalRecycle’s highly competitive Beverage Container Recycle Grant Program.
				<br> Our Recycling Ambassadors program is designed as a comprehensive project to improve recycling practices throughout Martinez schools. We use hands-on, project-based learning to foster environmental stewardship.</p>
			<h3>Rainwater Ambassadors</h3>
			<p>The NLC has worked with Lunchbox International to provide the professional expertise for rainwater catchment system training and installation. In this program, high school students are oriented to the issues of water conservation and rainwater catchment education through guest speaker presentations and offered job experience in rainwater catchment installation. </p>
			<h2> Internships</h2>
			<h3>Ecoliteracy Peer Mentoring Internship</h3>
			<p>The Ecoliteracy Project was designed to be a model of intra-school and community collaboration in ways that promote the care and stewardship of our city, our creeks and our bay. In this project, Martinez Unified students from grades K-5 have the opportunity to participate in grade appropriate, hands-on, place-based education about water quality, water conservation and watershed health. Over the last 10 years, student interns have taught more than 6,000 elementary students.</p>
				<h3>Community Science Internship</h3>
				<p>The NLC Community Science Workshop offers high school students in-school and after school internships to work with elementary school students in fostering curiosity and open ended exploration of science. Interns help young learners make connections as to why science is important to them and relevant in their lives.</p>
			<p>In CSW’s, high school students participate weekly in activities that fostered STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) and focused critical thinking. Interns are required to apply and be interviewed (same process as noted above) for this internship. CSW water-quality and conservation lessons include hands-on projects, displays and informative exhibits that focus on water quality, watershed stewardship and potable water conservation practices.</p>
